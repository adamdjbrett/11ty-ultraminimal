Welcome to this minimalist blog! This site combines the simplicity of **Eleventy** with the brutalist aesthetic of the **μ css framework**.

## Why μ?

The μ (mu) framework weighs in at just **1 kilobyte**. It provides just enough styling to make semantic HTML look good without any classes needed.

## Features

This blog includes:

- Fast static site generation with Eleventy 3.1.2
- Minimalist design with μ css
- RSS/Atom feeds for syndication
- Full sitemap for SEO
- No JavaScript required (except for build tools)

## Getting Started

Writing posts is simple. Just create a Markdown file in the `blog/` directory with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
description: A brief description
date: 2025-12-29
---
```

Then write your content in Markdown. That's it!
